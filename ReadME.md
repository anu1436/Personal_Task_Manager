# Personal Task Manager

__This Project is made to figure out efficiency between basic sorting algorithms. Feel free to play around with sortings__

## Description
The Personal Task Manager is a web application designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks. It uniquely integrates various sorting algorithms - bubble, selection, and insertion sort - allowing users to organize tasks based on their priorities, due dates, or any criteria they choose. Built with Flask, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this project combines backend logic with a responsive frontend design, making task management both efficient and visually appealing.

## Technologies Used
- Flask for the backend.
- JavaScript for dynamic frontend interactions.
- HTML & CSS for structure and styling.

## Features
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks with details like title, description, due date, and priority.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Utilize bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort to organize tasks.
- **Performance Metrics**: View the time it takes for each sorting algorithm to complete, helping users choose the most efficient method.
